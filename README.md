# stm32-simple-rtos
Developing a bare minimum kernel (or just a scheduler) for STM32-L432 MCU by following the [YouTube video series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPW8O6W-1chwyTzI3BHwBLbGQoPFxPAPM) offered by Dr. Miro Samek.

Note: This video series is using a different MCU and an IDE, but most of the implementation should be very similar since the STM32-L432 MCU is also using the ARM Cortex-M4 CPU, as in those tutorials.
